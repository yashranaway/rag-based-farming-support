    "Inference scaling in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) refers to techniques that enhance model performance by allocating computational resources during the [inference](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-inference) phase (when models generate outputs) rather than relying on larger [training datasets](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/training-data) or model architectures. As [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) continue to expand in both model parameters and dataset scale, optimizing inference time and managing inference compute scaling—particularly on GPU hardware—have become central challenges for deploying high-performance multimodal [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) systems. Recent advances in inference strategies that increase computational resources and employ complex algorithms at test-time—are redefining how LLMs tackle complex [reasoning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-reasoning) tasks and deliver higher-quality outputs across diverse input modalities. Inference scaling optimizes [chain of thought (CoT)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts) by expanding reasoning depth. This expansion allows models to produce longer, more detailed chains of thought through iterative prompting or multistep generation. Inference scaling can be leveraged to improve multimodal RAG, focusing on the interplay between model sizes, computer budgets and the practical optimization of inference time for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, scaling laws and [benchmark](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-benchmarks) results emphasize the tradeoffs between pretraining, [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning), inference-time strategies and advanced algorithms for output selection. Both larger models and smaller models benefit from inference scaling as it also enables resource-constrained systems to approach the performance of cutting-edge LLMs. This tutorial demonstrates the impact of optimization techniques on model performance, offering actionable guidance for balancing accuracy, [latency](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latency) and cost in multimodal RAG deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed for artificial intelligence developers, researchers and enthusiasts looking to enhance their knowledge of document management and advanced [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) techniques. You will learn how to harness the power of inference scaling to improve the multimodal RAG pipeline created in a [previous recipe](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-snack-cookbook/blob/main/recipes/RAG/Granite_Multimodal_RAG.ipynb). While this tutorial focuses on strategies for scalability in multimodal RAG specifically focused on IBM® Granite® large language models, similar principles are applicable to most popular models including those from OpenAI (for example, GPT-4, GPT-4o, ChatGPT) and DeepMind.\n"

    "This tutorial guides you through the following processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document preprocessing: You will learn how to handle documents from various sources, parse and transform them into usable formats and store them in vector databases by using [Docling](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/build-document-question-answering-system-with-docling-and-granite). Docling is an IBM open-source toolkit used to efficiently parse document formats—such as PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, images, HTML, AsciiDoc and Markdown. It then exports the document contents into machine-readable formats like Markdown or JSON. You will use a Granite [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) model to generate image descriptions of images in the documents. In this tutorial, Docling will download the PDF documents and process them so we can obtain the text and images the documents contain. In this tutorial Docling will download the PDF documents and process them so we can obtain the text and images the documents contain. \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation): Understand how to connect LLMs such as Granite with external knowledge bases to enhance query responses and generate valuable insights. RAG is a large language model (LLMs) technique used to connect LLMs with a knowledge base of information outside the data the LLM has been trained. This technique is applied to LLMs without the need for [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rag-vs-fine-tuning). Traditional RAG is limited to text-based use cases such as text summarization and chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multimodal RAG: Learn how multimodal RAG uses [multimodal](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multimodal-ai) large language models (MLLMs) to process information from multiple types of data. This data can then be included as part of the external knowledge base used in RAG. Multimodal data can include text, images, audio, video or other forms. In this tutorial, we use IBM's latest multimodal vision model, Granite 3.2 vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing demonstration-based RAG (DRAG) and iterative demonstration-based RAG (IterDRAG): Apply the inference scaling techniques from the research paper to significantly improve RAG performance when working with long [context](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window). The DRAG method leverages in-context learning to improve RAG performance. By including multiple RAG examples as demonstrations, DRAG helps models learn to locate relevant information in long contexts. Unlike standard RAG that might plateau with more documents, DRAG shows linear improvements with increased context length. IterDRAG is an extension of DRAG that addresses complex multihop queries by decomposing them into simpler subqueries. Multihop is a process where a complex query is broken down and answered in simple subquestions. Each subquestion might require information retrieved and or synthesized from different sources. IterDRAG interleaves retrieval and generation steps, creating reasoning chains that bridge compositional gaps. This approach is particularly effective for handling complex queries across long contexts.\n",

They implemented safety protocols, reduced volunteer numbers for social distancing, and altered their distribution model to allow partner agencies to receive food safely. The pandemic created unprecedented food insecurity, with many people seeking assistance for the first time. MFB distributed 37% more food than in 2019, with a record 179 semi-loads of Disaster Relief family food boxes sent nationwide. The organization also faced supply chain disruptions and food procurement challenges in the early months but continued to find and distribute food. Community, business, and donor support helped fund operations and food purchases. Additionally, MFB began participating in the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box program in May 2020, distributing over $52 million worth of nutritious produce, protein, and dairy products.\",\n",

Despite the pandemic creating safety challenges, volunteers demonstrated courage and dedication by increasing their hours to meet growing needs. MFB implemented safety protocols at each location and limited volunteer group sizes to allow for social distancing. This created a challenge as food needs increased while fewer volunteers were available to help. To address this gap, multiple MFB locations received assistance from the National Guard, who filled vital volunteer positions driving trucks, operating forklifts, and helping with food distributions. In 2020, 17,930 individuals volunteered 300,898 hours of service, equivalent to 150 full-time employees. The volunteer-to-staff ratio was remarkable with 450 volunteers for every 1 paid MFB staff member, highlighting the volunteer-driven nature of the organization during the crisis.\",\n",

In East Africa (operated as Kapu Africa), strict lockdowns led to mass hunger, especially in slum areas. Kapu Africa distributed 7.2 million Tender Mercies meals, working with partner ministries to share food in food-insecure slums. A notable outcome was a spiritual awakening among recipients, with many asking why they were receiving help. In Haiti, the pandemic added to existing challenges, closing airports, seaports, factories, and schools. MFB Haiti more than doubled its food shipments to Haiti, delivering over 160 tons of food relief, nearly three-quarters being Tender Mercies meals. As Haitian children primarily receive nourishment from school lunches, MFB Haiti distributed Tender Mercies through faith-based schools and also partnered with over 20 feeding centers serving approximately 1,100 children daily.

    "In this tutorial, we've explored how inference scaling can dramatically improve RAG performance. By strategically allocating additional computation at inference time through techniques like DRAG and IterDRAG, we can achieve substantial gains in response quality for complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with traditional RAG and transformer-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "Expensive inference: Transformer-based models, which use self-attention mechanisms, have inference costs that scale quadratically with input length. This method makes handling long contexts computationally expensive, limiting the practical application of RAG to shorter documents or requiring aggressive truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited context utilization: Standard RAG systems often retrieve and process a fixed number of documents that can be insufficient for complex, multihop queries. Performance plateaus as context length increases, especially beyond 128,000 tokens, because the model struggles to synthesize information across many retrieved passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inefficient computation allocation: Without careful allocation, adding more retrieved documents or context simply increases computational cost without proportional gains in accuracy, leading to diminishing returns or even degraded performance due to information overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DRAG and IterDRAG address these challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demonstration-based RAG (DRAG):**\n",
    "\n",
    "DRAG leverages multiple retrieved examples, questions and answers as demonstrations within the prompt, enabling the model to learn in-context how to locate and apply relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly effective for shorter effective context lengths as it allows the model to utilize rich context without overwhelming the attention mechanism, improving both retrieval and generation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative demonstration-based RAG (IterDRAG):**\n",
    "\n",
    "IterDRAG decomposes complex queries into simpler subqueries, iteratively retrieving and generating answers for each substep.\n",
    "\n",
    "By interleaving retrieval and generation, IterDRAG builds reasoning chains that bridge the gap for multihop queries, making it especially effective for exceptionally long contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows the model to allocate computation more efficiently, focusing on the most relevant information at each step and avoiding the risk of long-context attention overload. By applying these inference scaling techniques to your RAG applications, you can achieve significantly better performance on knowledge-intensive tasks without changing your underlying models."
